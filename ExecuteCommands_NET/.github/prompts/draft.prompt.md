 can we enhance the  functionality that comes up when we say what can I say

 please can we create a new form for this functionality SearchVisualStudioCommandsWPF

  if we are in Visual Studio can we have a search text box that can be used to filter all the commands available and can we utilize these vs_commands.json file to populate the search results 

  The search results can show a description of what that command does and also show an example of how to say that command in natural language

    because it will be used by voice users we need to make sure we have access keys for all the controls.

     the search results will need to be sorted by category and then alphabetically within each category. they should show these keyboard shot cuts in a user friendly way.

      we can have a search box at the top to filter commands by name or description

       we can also have a button to copy the natural language command to clipboard for easy pasting into other applications

        finally we need to make sure the dialog is accessible and works well with screen readers

          we can have a button to open the location of the vs_commands.json file in file explorer for easy editing if needed

          the form should also documentation on how to refresh this file using the command line tool  that is part of this repo

           please can we make sure the form is well designed and user friendly for voice users
