When we are not in Visual Studio and we issue the voice command natural what can I say can we have another form to popup with all the available global commands?

Also can we have the ability to type in a TextBox and shows such results and by default have no results returned for performance reasons until the user starts typing?

 currently we are using the DisplayMessage  form but I think we need a new one.

  can we make the fonts though the same and the front size as the current DisplayMessage form?

  Also Dark Mode please.
